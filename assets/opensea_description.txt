A collection of 18 toadz traveling the blockchain to raise funds for humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

These toadz are looking for a temporary place to stay, do you have spare room in your wallet? They promise to be the perfect guest!

Simply mint a toad by donating 0.01 eth, and it will gratefully hop straight into your wallet. You can also offer to host an already minted toad in your wallet by matching or increasing the last donation. It will bid you a fond farewell to its previous host and leave them a pair of glasses as a memento.

100% of the funds raised go directly via Uncahin Fund to the Ukraine humanitarian effort.

The toadz and the glasses cannot be listed for sale.
